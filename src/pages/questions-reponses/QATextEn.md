## Questions and answers

As Verdun residents, we've seen the success and acclaim of the summer pedestrianization of Wellington and its benefits to the community. Our proposal to extend this pedestrianization has led to many questions on its rationale and feasibility:

## Why should Wellington be a pedestrian street?

Pedestrianizing Wellington year-round would:
- **Increase comfort and safety** for the high volume of vulnerable road users - [over 5 million pedestrians per year](https://commercesmtl.com/fr/local-commercial/promenade-wellington). This means being able to cross the street without hesitation, or being able to comfortably walk side by side as a couple or with a group of friends.

- **Improve the quality of the urban environment** on Verdun's main commercial street by reducing noise pollution and adding vegetation, art, and communal spaces.

- **Reduce car use and dependency** which is [essential to meeting our emissions reductions targets](https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-electric-vehicles-car-dependence-1.6534893), as [43% of our emissions in Quebec are from transportation](https://www.quebec.ca/gouvernement/politiques-orientations/plan-economie-verte/actions-lutter-contre-changements-climatiques/reduire-ges-transport).

- **Improve social equity** by re-appropriating the roadway occupied by private vehicles into an equitable public space suitable for socializing, shopping, or leisure.

- **Promote local commerce** as [pedestrian streets are more economically productive](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/1/16/why-walkable-streets-are-more-economically-productive) and encourage business activity.

This right to initiative petition refers to Article 24(d) of the _Montréal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities_ published in 2006. In that article, the city pledges to “promote active mobility by limiting the use of automobiles in an urban milieu.” Despite this pledge, [the number of passenger vehicles in circulation on Montreal's roads has since increased by 16%](https://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=6897,67889677&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL) from 677,659 in 2006 to 788,987 in 2020.

This increase is attributed entirely to the growth in non-commercial passenger vehicles, particularly SUVs and pickup trucks.

Car-free streets and zones are one of the most effective ways to reduce car dependence and reverse this trend. This change will also have beneficial impacts on safety, community vitality, and commerce. We also expect this initiative will serve as inspiration for other neighbourhoods and cities.

## Who is advocating for this?

Residents of Verdun with an interest in social equity and a desire to improve our urban environment.

## What part of Wellington are you proposing to be pedestrianized?

We propose pedestrianizing the same area as in the summer - from Rue Regina to 6e avenue.

## How will this impact accessibility?

Wellington should be universally accessible. Seniors, wheelchair users, and parents with strollers can benefit from the pedestrianization of streets. The public consultation we're requesting will be an opportunity to prioritize vulnerable road users and re-imagine our infrastructure for inclusivity and accessibility.

Wellington currently has a number of accessibility obstacles. A pedestrian street would be an opportunity to resolve these issues by adding access ramps, and in the future, [raising the street](https://hudsoncountyview.com/n-j-group-names-jersey-citys-newark-ave-pedestrian-plaza-municipal-project-of-the-year/) to be level with storefront doors. For now in the summer, we have additional curb access ramps in the summer, and reserved accessible parking on cross-streets.

A consideration when discussing accessibility is the variety of health conditions that can impact mobility, many of which do not fit into our presumptions. For instance, there are cognitive, neurological, and motor function disorders that make driving impractical or impossible.

On accessibility for seniors, it's important to note that [we outlive our driving years by on average a decade](https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2020/03/05/aging-population-needs-walkable-bikeable-cities).

> One in five people over 65 don't drive. By age 80, 65 percent are no longer driving, while only 40 percent have difficulty walking. Seniors eventually have to give up driving even as they are still able to walk.

Seniors over 65 represent 18% of the population of Quebec [but half of pedestrians killed in collisions each year.](https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/2020-02-15/aines-tues-par-des-automobilistes-la-derniere-marche) As with children, passenger cars present a threat to the safety and independence of seniors and are not an equitable solution for their mobility.

_We want to hear from mobility-reduced people to understand needs and concerns, so we can advocate for a vision of the Well that is accessible and sustainable. If you or someone you know would like to be in touch about this, [email us](mailto:lawellpietonne@gmail.com)._

## Won't business suffer if Wellington is pedestrianized?

In short, no.[ Pedestrian streets encourage business activity and are more economically productive](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/1/16/why-walkable-streets-are-more-economically-productive). Concerns about deliveries, parking and its impact on business are often mentioned when bike lanes or public squares are built in our city. On the whole,[ these fears do not materialize](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/jean-talon-market-merchants-coming-around-to-new-square-despite-loss-of-parking).

Business on Wellington is already exceptional. According to the SDC, businesses on this street have [a five-year a survival rate nearing 70%](https://www.promenadewellington.com/en/open-your-business-on-the-strip/), exceeding the Canadian average. If business revenue must meet a threshold for pedestrianization to be considered, Wellington is an appropriate choice, already [meeting the prescribed standards](https://collectivitesviables.org/articles/rues-pietonnes.aspx#prrequis-7) for a pedestrian street.

The rise in foot traffic on Wellington once car traffic and all street parking is removed has already been quantified. In 2021, Wellington's second year of summer pedestrianization, [foot traffic increased by 17%](https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/grand-montreal/2022-04-04/dix-rues-de-montreal-reservees-aux-pietons-pour-les-trois-prochains-etes.php).

We do not claim or expect universal increases in revenue for every business. In the case of Verdun, a neighbourhood with suitable density, foot traffic, metro access, and a road network that predates the passenger car, we believe our local businesses should cater primarily to the tens of thousands of residents (and customers) living in close proximity to Wellington.

If we want this to work, the borough and SDC will need to play a continued role in ensuring that one kind of business is not favoured over others. [Bylaws can be used to encourage variety](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/bylaw-limiting-restaurants-now-applies-to-all-of-notre-dame-st) in businesses on a commercial street so that essential services like grocers, pharmacies, and community centres are not squeezed out financially.

## What about buses?

Wellington is normally served by bus routes 58 and 61 - summer pedestrianization requires deviating these routes to adjacent streets. For this, a number of solutions can be considered.

Mont-Royal's SDC [offers free taxi service](https://montreal.ca/articles/pietonnisation-de-lavenue-du-mont-royal-14483) for seniors or those with reduced mobility every day during pedestrianization of Mont-Royal Avenue. On Wellington, we can use shuttles, paratransit, and the vélo-taxis used in the summer can also have service expanded.

While Boul Lasalle and Rue de Verdun are better suited as arterial roads for commuting, cross streets like de l'Église and Galt will continue to be served by bus routes, and additional routes could be added on other perpendicular streets crossing Wellington.

Ultimately, if these alternatives do not meet our needs, buses on Wellington can of course still run at certain hours, or days of the week, or times of the year, or on parts of the street. This could balance the benefits of a car-free street with the convenience of a bus service that passes at a slow speed.

## What about bikes?

We support the coexistence of cyclists, non-motorized vehicles, and mobility aids on a pedestrianized Wellington street. Limitations can be set, such as during special events.

According to guidelines in _CROW Design Manual for Bicycle Traffic_, [pedestrians and cyclists can coexist given parameters for the size of the street and foot traffic](https://collectivitesviables.org/articles/rues-pietonnes.aspx) (Less than 200 pedestrians per hour per meter of street width). Ongoing discussion on design and needs of residents and commuters can determine the appropriate configuration.

Other considerations for street design, low speed limits, scooter restrictions, and awareness campaigns will help Montreal's growing cycling culture coexist on such a street.

It shows many pedestrians at the top, including a jogger, a person holding a white cane, and others using mobility aids. Below it is a bike, cargo bike, transit, ride share and a single passenger car at the bottom." />

## Won't this accelerate gentrification?

Streets and businesses are not what make a community like Verdun great – it's the people and its connections that make it great. We love our community, and it's essential Verdun be kept affordable to low income and long term residents.

The housing crisis is among the most pressing issues faced by residents of Montreal. Regulations must be strengthened and enforced to combat speculation, greed, and predatory real estate ownership practices.

Although we are committed to addressing these inequities in our city, the focus of this initiative is to address transportation inequity and its impact on public health and safety.

Addressing environmental gentrification requires regulatory changes, and should be dealt with urgently by higher levels of government and community organizations. We'd like to acknowledge the organizations doing work on the issue of tenants rights in Verdun:

[Comité d'action des citoyennes et citoyens de Verdun](https://cacv-verdun.org/)

[The Coalition of Housing Committees and Tenants Associations of Quebec's (RCLALQ)](https://rclalq.qc.ca/en/)

## Won't it be noisy?

Patrons of restaurants and festival-goers can be loud, but these are attributes of a vibrant city with things in it, not an attribute of a pedestrian street. Bars existed before pedestrianization, and the same rowdiness exists without pedestrianization. 

We are confident removing all motor vehicles from a street will not make our neighbourhood any louder. On their own, [Cities Aren't Loud: Cars Are Loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTV-wwszGw8).

## Won't it back up traffic on other streets?

By making streets and whole areas of our city pleasant and practical to exist in without a car, we will reduce car usage and therefore traffic. According to the Case Studies on Transport Policy, implementing car-free zones [are effective in reducing car use by 10-20%](https://theconversation.com/12-best-ways-to-get-cars-out-of-cities-ranked-by-new-research-180642).

It's up to us and our elected officials to take real action in reducing the number of cars on our roads. The more space we provide cars, [the more we induce demand for cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). The less space we provide to passenger cars, the more we will induce demand for collective and compact forms of transportation over a longer period. With temporary summer pedestrianization, this long term incentive does not exist, so the disruption never goes away.

## Where will people park?

The loss of street parking is not an unfortunate consequence of pedestrianization but a crucial step to reducing the use and prevalence of automobiles in our city. That said, there are an abundance of reserved accessible, and paid parking spots on perpendicular streets, as well as several public and private lots.

If you're interested in this topic, we recommend reading the summary in the _Conseil régional de l'environnement de Montréal_'s 2023 white book [_Le stationnement à Montréal : 23 propositions pour une mobilité efficace, équitable et écologique_](https://cdn.ca.yapla.com/company/CPYdNZRxWi163lmbLnVjgAqMF/asset/files/Outils/2023-03-02_CRE-Montreal_Livre-blanc-VF_numerique.pdf) that outlines innovative ways we can make efficient use of existing space for vehicles.

    This is not a lack of parking space but a misallocation of parking space.

## Isn't Montreal too cold for a pedestrian street?

Montreal may be cold, but we still invest in our parks, sporting fields, benches, and other outdoor amenities that are less ideal in the winter. Cold winter days are simply a fact of life even for those who have the financial privilege of shovelling their car out of a snow bank.

A survey conducted by the city of Montreal reveals that our existing habits are compatible with a pedestrian street - there is [little change in modes of commute to Place Wellington in the summer vs the winter](https://www.realisonsmtl.ca/3113/widgets/15839/documents/10936) (13% vs 20% by car for each season respectively).

Cold climate living predates the automobile by thousands of years and to this day some of the most renowned pedestrian streets in America and around the world are in climates colder, snowier, rainier, and gloomier than ours.

</figure>

The only thing worse than walking in the cold on Wellington is walking in the cold on Wellington on its narrow slushy sidewalks with cars rolling by.

## How will snow be plowed?

Most pedestrian streets do not physically prevent vehicles from entering, they just don't allow them. Snow can be plowed with existing street and sidewalk plowing equipment.

> According to the City of Montreal, the costs of snow removal on a pedestrian street are similar to those on streets open to car traffic. [Source](https://journalmetro.com/local/ids-verdun/3072854/wellington-la-rue-la-plus-cool-au-monde-pietonne-a-lannee/)

## How will emergency vehicles and delivery trucks have access?

As in the summer, emergency and delivery vehicles are exempted. Even the highest volumes of pedestrian traffic [are compatible with emergency vehicles](https://twitter.com/extrapostage/status/1604943256135016449).
