        In 2018, the plaza was expanded to 400 metres in length. In 2022, a USD$7 million renovation was completed. Along with new benches, bike racks, a stage for community events, vegetation and trees, the city raised the street with granite pavers for universal wheelchair and stroller accessibility. 

        “The creation of the Pedestrian Plaza was a risk our administration took when first elected as there was significant pushback, but I think over time it has become clear to everyone that the changes we made there have attracted more people, allowed more businesses to open, and created a destination spot for visitors and residents,” said Mayor Steven Fulop.

        There were protests back then. Cries of \"we're not Italians! We don't want to walk!\" were heard in the city. Shopkeepers feared for their businesses. Fortunately, the idea was implemented by the City of Copenhagen.
        
        This was a turning point in the modern life of Copenhagen. Cars were taking over, fewer people were cycling and the city was congested and polluted. Visionary political decision-making and urban planning was needed and it arrived.

The following year, the street was pedestrianized for a week, with transit added on surrounding streets. The experiment was an obvious success. 
        
        After years of dialogue and planning, the street was then made into a permanent pedestrian street. Today, millions of visitors come to socialize, celebrate, pass time, and shop at one of over a hundred shops and restaurants on the street.`,
